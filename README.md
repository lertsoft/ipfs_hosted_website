portfolio website.

# `About the website`

The website was build base on the necesities that I had. <br>
Meaning I needed a place where i could host everything that i do in my professional and hobbyist life but also is personal and unique to me. <br>
That it includes and shows my personality and ideas in a simple way.

# `Run this locally`

To run this website locally on your machine I would recommend using the extension "Live Server" on Visual Studio Code. <br>
I found that to be the easiest to do and use.

# * TO DO's *
1. Fix portfolio tab and the education/experience tab. Now when someone click any of them the other is affected, which it shoould not, and also every time the education/expereince tab is pressed the entire goes goes to the footer, which it should not.
2.  Add multilingual support. Mainly spanish as that is my main language.
3.  Add a photography gallery for the photos to open full screen and allow for full screen viewing.
