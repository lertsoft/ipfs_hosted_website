# `About the website`

The website was build base on the necesities that I had. <br>
Meaning I needed a place where i could host everything that i do in my professional and hobbyist life but also is personal and unique to me. <br>
That it includes and shows my personality and ideas in a simple way.

# `Run this locally`

To run this website locally on your machine I would recommend using the extension "Live Server" on Visual Studio Code. <br>
I found that to be the easiest to do and use.
