# `About the website`

The website was build base on the necesities that I had. <br>
Meaning I needed a place where i could host everything that i do in my professional and hobbyist life but also is personal and unique to me. <br>
That it includes and shows my personality and ideas in a simple way.<br>
<br>
This website does not use any library or framework as it was an experiment to see how much I can do using vanilla Javascript (Plain JS), HTML, and CSS. the only import done to this project is the swiper function. <br>
Design wise I heavily used open source icons, and graphics to improve the sites looks.

# `Run this locally`

To run this website locally on your machine I would recommend using the extension "Live Server" on Visual Studio Code. <br>
I found that extension to make local development more easy and less repetitive.

# * TO DO's *
1. Fix portfolio tab and the education/experience tab. Now when someone click any of them the other is affected, which it shoould not, and also every time the education/expereince tab is pressed the entire goes goes to the footer, which it should not.
2.  ~~Add a custom domain~~.
3.  ~~Make it more realible~~.
